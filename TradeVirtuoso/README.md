# Problem Statement Name: TradeVirtuoso

# Problem Statement Details:
Our project focuses on creating a virtual stock trading website tailored for beginners eager to learn about stock trading but hesitant to dive into real market. This platform offers a safe environment for users to practice trading, gain experience, and boost confidence without real financial risks. Additionally, we'll include a virtual money playground, allowing users to learn, purchase, and sell stocks in a simulated market setting.

# Approach:
1. Simulated Trading Playground: Users can access a virtual environment where they can engage in simulated stock trading using virtual funds. The platform provides real-time market data and pricing information to simulate actual trading conditions. Users can experiment with different investment strategies, track performance, and gain hands-on experience without financial risk.
2. Discussion Platform: A dedicated space for users to participate in discussions related to stock trading, investment strategies, market trends, and financial news. Users can write and publish blogs to share insights, tips, and experiences with the community. The platform includes social features such as following other users, liking blog posts, and commenting to encourage interaction and knowledge sharing.
3. Media Integration: Users can enrich their content by adding media such as images, charts, infographics, and videos to their blogs and discussions. Media content can be used to illustrate concepts, analyze stock performance, and provide visual aids for learning. The platform allows users to upload and share media files to enhance the educational
value of their contributions and help others gain a deeper understanding of stock trading concepts.

   b)Design a stock recommendation system using CatBoost.
   c)Design a resistance, support recognition system to identify good entry and exit points in a stock.
   d)Design a breakout detection system to identify potential bullish/bearish breakouts in a stock.
   e)Sentiment analysis using NLP.
2. Web Development:
   a) Design the frontend of the website including home page with sections like create post, see others' posts etc., profile page to view any user's profile, post likes, bookmarks,           follow options etc., learning playground which will redirect to the stock learner's simulator.
   b) Design the authentication page for a better experience for all users.
   c) Work on the backend of the entire page.
   d) Deployment of the website.
(Flexible to some changes.)
